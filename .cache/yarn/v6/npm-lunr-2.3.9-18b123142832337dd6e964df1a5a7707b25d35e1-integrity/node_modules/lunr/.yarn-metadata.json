It indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for retrieving documents that best match text queries.\n\n## Why\n\nFor web applications with all their data already sitting in the client, it makes sense to be able to search that data on the client too.  It saves adding extra, compacted services on the server.  A local search index will be quicker, there is no network overhead, and will remain available and usable even without a network connection.\n\n## Installation\n\nSimply include the lunr.js source file in the page that you want to use it.  Lunr.js is supported in all modern browsers.\n\nAlternatively an npm package is also available `npm install lunr`.\n\nBrowsers that do not support ES5 will require a JavaScript shim for Lunr to work. You can either use [Augment.js](https://github.com/olivernn/augment.js), [ES5-Shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim) or any library that patches old browsers to provide an ES5 compatible JavaScript environment.\n\n## Features\n\n* Full text search support for 14 languages\n* Boost terms at query time or boost entire documents at index time\n* Scope searches to specific fields\n* Fuzzy term matching with wildcards or edit distance\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [`CONTRIBUTING.md` file](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",
