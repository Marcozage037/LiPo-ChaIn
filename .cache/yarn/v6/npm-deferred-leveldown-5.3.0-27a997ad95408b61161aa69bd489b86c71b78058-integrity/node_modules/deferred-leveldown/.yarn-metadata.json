Chained-batch operations are converted before being stored.\n\n```js\nconst deferred  = require('deferred-leveldown')\nconst leveldown = require('leveldown')\n\nconst db = deferred(leveldown('location'))\n\ndb.put('foo', 'bar', function (err) {\n\n})\n\ndb.open(function (err) {\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n**If you are upgrading:** please see [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\n[`Level/deferred-leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/deferred-leveldown) is an **OPEN Open Source Project**.
