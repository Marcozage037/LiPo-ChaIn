    "readme": "# vega-event-selector\n\nA CSS-inspired language to select, sequence, and compose DOM events into event streams.\n\nExports the following method:\n\n<a name=\"selector\" href=\"#selector\">#</a>\nvega.<b>selector</b>(<i>selector</i>[, <i>source</i>, <i>marks</i>])\n[<>](https://github.com/vega/vega/blob/master/packages/vega-event-selector/src/event-selector.js \"Source\")\n\nTakes an [event _selector_ string](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/event-streams/#selector) as input and returns a parsed [event stream object](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/event-streams/#object) definition. The optional _source_ argument takes a string indicating the source value to use by default (normally `\"view\"`). The optional _marks_ argument takes an object whose keys will be treated as the legal mark types, so long as the corresponding values are truthy. For more, see the [Vega Event Stream documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/event-streams).\n",
